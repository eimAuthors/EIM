This was a temporary repository and account to ensure anonymity during the double blind review process at ICLR 2020. The paper was accepted, and we since moved the repository to https://github.com/pbecker93/ExpectedInformationMaximization.   This repository will not be updated, nor will any notifications reach us. Please refer to the new repository. Correspondence via E-Mail to: philipp.becker@kit.edu
